# Language Translator

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a Language Translator using advanced neural network models. The project leverages the Transformer architecture to provide high-quality machine translation between English and Italian. This translator is designed as a practical application to showcase the capabilities of state-of-the-art NLP models in understanding and generating human-like text.

## Features
- Utilizes the Transformer model architecture for translation tasks.
- Provides examples of text translation from English to Italian.
- Includes detailed annotations to explain the steps involved in the model's training and inference phases.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need:
- Python 3.8 or above
- PyTorch 1.8 or later
- Transformers library by Hugging Face
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install torch transformers numpy jupyter

## INSTALLATION
